Manchester Social Entrepreneurs Challenge - Hack Manchester Junior Half Term Youth Hacks 2016

## Background

[Manchester Social Entrepreneurs](http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Social-Entrepreneurs/) is a tiny bare bones computer designed to inspire people of all ages to learn to code and build things. We want to see these people become creative technologists.

## The challenge

Home recycling is a massive problem in today’s society. We’re pushed to recycle but it’s not made easy. How can we use existing technology to help encourage families to recycle more efficiently and effectively? Could this be monetised or incentivised? Let’s help keep our world sustainable!
